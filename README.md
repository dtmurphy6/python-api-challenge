# Unit 6 Homework: What's the Weather Like?

Compelted WeatherPy and VacationPy homework. Images for WeatherPy are named accordingly and listed in the main folder. Screenshots of the heat maps are named accordingly with and without hotel data and are in the main folder. See my observations regarding the WeatherPy data below.

## Three observations

1. The north pole, south pole, and the equator almost always have cloud cover.
2. As we approach the equator the temperature rises which makes sense as that is the equator is the closest point to the sun.
3. Wind speed and humidity do not have  strong correlation to latitude.
